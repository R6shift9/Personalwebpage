         <div id="summary">

       <p>
         Thank you for checking out my webpage! This webpage is designed to give you a brief summary of my educational background and work experience. I graduated from California State University San Marcos in 2013 where I Majored in Political Science and Minored in Music Technology.
<br/><br/>After graduation, I went to go work as an Account Executive for a small logistics company that specialized in LTL to Canada. I developed my own book of business through a combination of inside and outside sales. Since the company was small, I had to handle all aspects of the business cycle. I would prospect and close accounts, set up the billing, provide rates, provide customer service and on occasion set up pick ups and deliveries. I would regularly visit my active accounts and check in on other accounts to try and develop more business. Radiant Global Logistics acquired our company in 2015, they reduced our operations staff and it became hard to maintain my accounts so I decided to try something new.
<br/><br/>I  went to work for a hardware/software provider in the payments industry as an account manager. The position was a considered an internal farm program for their outside representatives as they had a wide variety of products and services. While I was there I worked on the indirect sales channel by managing the relationships with the companies distributors. I managed two distributors and supported six others, which was 60% of the company&apos;s business. I created reports for my accounts, booked purchase orders, attended trade shows and monitored inventory. I also handled incoming emails and phone calls for general sales inquiries, provide support for current users, supported outside sales representatives clients and helped 3rd parties integrate our hardware into their payments solution. After my six month review, I didn&apos;t see any growth opportunities in the near or intermediate term, so I decided to leave.
<br/><br/>I accepted an Account Executive position for one of the largest payments processors in North America. The role was 100% inside sales and required me to prospect and close businesses that had customers who paid with corporate purchasing cards. While I was there I learned how to read and interpret credit card statements, PCI rules surrounding accepting credit card payments and how to get merchants the best possible rates for accepting electronic payments. After working there for four months I decided to explore other options.
<br/><br/>Since leaving I have been looking for better sales opportunities as well as Analyst and Web developer positions. I have been studying web design, which is how I built this webpage. You can check out the school section to see what courses I have completed. This website is coded using only HTML/CSS, feel free to click the logos to learn more about the companies I've worked for and educational background.

             <li>TSYS</li>
             <p><strong>Account Executive-Corporate Sales</strong>-
  Acquire new merchants by identifying the most optimal payments processing solution for their business. Perform analyses on merchant statements to identify areas of improvement such as penalties, interchange management and processing fees. Forecast closing dates for new accounts; generate proposals for merchants and sign accounts.
  </p>
  <li>MAGTEK</li>
  <p><strong>Account Manager</strong>-
As a account manager my responsibilities were to manage the distribution network, identify and develop new business opportunities, help current users trouble shoot, assist 3rd parties with integrating Magtek hardware and provide reports for the executive team. I was an oracle Super-user and had access to all aspects of our supply chain software. My team was also responsible for testing and using the new CRM Sugar to update leads and track the progress of prospects.
<br/><br/>I attended tradeshows and helped provide demos for new products. Our VP of business development also tasked me to manage our outside sales representatives pipelines and provide weekly reports.
During my stay, I managed two distribution accounts and supported six others, which was about 60% of the business. I helped some large customers integrate Magtek hardware for their payment solutions and lastly I helped maintain current accounts by providing support to the outside sales representatives.

           <li>WheelsMSM</li>
            <p><strong> Account Executive</strong>-
As an Account Executive I was responsible for growing my assigned territory of Orange County and San Diego. The goal was to board new accounts to our established LTL(less than truckload) lanes which were from Southern California to all parts of Canada and the North Eastern United States. Our secondary objective was to expand the new services Wheels provided, which were domestic truckload/rail shipments.
<br/><br/>I accomplished this by prospecting my own leads through manufacturer yellow pages, Google maps, referrals, driving through industrial parks and occasionally walking into warehouses. I also utilized marketing materials and mass emails to generate interest from prospective accounts.
<br/><br/>Our company was small so I was very involved with my accounts and would be their primary contact for everything from rates, tracing, customer service, billing, etc. I would meet my accounts regularly for lunch, bring donuts/coffee for the office and be involved with their specific needs. I would also set up bids and custom pricing sheets for my large prospects like Canon, CottonOn and Tropicana.
<br/><br/>I was hired with three other reps and I was the first to cover my salary and expenses with in the first four months. I was also the only one who did not have to have a meeting to review my numbers in the first year. After one of the other reps left I was given his territory and some of his accounts to manage.
<br/><br/>During my stay, I was able to pull in over 1.5 million dollars in new business and maintain the highest profit margin out of the other new hires.
